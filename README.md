This web scraper is built using Ruby Programming language. It is a capstone project that is part of the Microverse curriculum, developed to showcase the author's ability to develop a project based on Ruby & any given business logic.

## Project Design:

![screenshot](assets/project_screenshot.PNG)

This project is a Web Scraper that takes information from Medium Website. It scrapes some articles written by Microverse students & any other articles that have anything to do with Microverse in generall. The scraper takes the information retrieved from the website & uses Nokogiri gem to store everything as an object. I then took this object & retrieve each article information and display it in a way that's more readable & organised. The articles are displayed in discending order based on the number of claps ( which in this case is the popularity that you see when you run the code. )

## Built With

- Ruby
- Rspec (testing)
- HTTParty
- Nokogiri
- Rubocop

- Pry (for debugging)
