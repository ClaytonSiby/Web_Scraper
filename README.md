![screenshot](assets/project_screenshot.PNG)

This project is Web Scraper that takes information from Medium Website. It scrapes some articles written by Microverse students & any other articles that have anything to do with Microverse in generall. The scraper takes the information retrieved from the website & uses Nokogiri gem to store everything as an array of objects. I then took this array of objects & retrieve each article information and display it in a way that's more readable & organised. The articles are displayed in discending order based on the number of claps ( which in this case is the popularity that you see when you run the code. )
